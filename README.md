# NodeJs-Assignmnet
A CRUD app using NodeJs

the files used to build the server are :
index.js
infoSchema.js
router.js

the files used to build the front-end are : 
App.js
table.js
form.js

The database has been connected successfully.
Written the code for CRUD operation.
But faced some problem while developing the front-end. ( Error when I used a map function )
